    Each third party is associated with a bookkeeping account (traditionally
    either the AR or AP account).  A third party's account can be accessed by
    calling "get_third_party(thid_party)" on the asscoiated account.  This also
    works in combination with Projects: call get_third_party from the project's
    AR and AP accounts instead of the global ones.

    This is a simplified accounting model for client and vendor accounts: a
    simple sub-account of "Accounts Receivable" or "Accounts Payable", that
    completely ignore invoices (for now).  Future versions may embrace a more
    complex model, including:

        invoices:
            invoices are sent to client or received from the vendor.
            each is a collection of AccountEntries to revenue, which only posted to ARs when the invoice is "posted". (Ie, delivered to the client)
            each has a post date, due date.. etc.
            when payments come in, they are added as credit AccountEntries for the the invoice (and client) and debits to a bank account
            completely paid invoices are marked as PAID.
        Jobs:
            a long-term project for a client is called a "job" and can invole multiple invoices.  (Eg. if it lasts longer than a month, you'll have related bills to pay.)
